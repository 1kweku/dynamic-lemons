        Hello! My name is Kweku Adarkwa. I graduated from Monmouth University
        with a bachelors in Psychology but have more recently graduated from
        Rutgers Full Stack Coding bootcamp. Below is my fledgling portfolio
        showcasing what I learned during the course. If you have any inquiries
        or comments, feel free to reach out with through the contact section of
        this page.
