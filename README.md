# Portfolio


## Description

My portfolio displays different aspects of the full stack using Javascript, from strictly front end projects such as the Quiz app, backend projects such as ecommerce and projects that utilize both front and back end technologies, such as Movie-Lovers. This portoflio is still a work in progress and will be more polished as my skills develop.

## Installation

As this is a personal portfolio, I ask that this project not be installed, but the links provided in the usage section will allow you to open the app on your local device for further observation. If interested in collaboration, please take a look at my other repositories!

## Usage

To access my portfolio, follow this link https://1kweku.github.io/dynamic-lemons/#about, or click the hyper linked image below. Doing so will take you to the about me section where you can learn a little bit about myself. The fully functional navigation bar on the top left of the page allows you to view my resume, contact me and see some of my projects. The footer also provides further links to communicate via Email, Twitter and GitHub.
